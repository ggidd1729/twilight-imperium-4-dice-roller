This program is an assistive tool for the board game Twilight Imperium 4.
It currently takes input from the command-line and rolls dice for space combat.
Flagships are not yet supported. I plan to add these as well as rolling for space cannon, anti-fighter barrage, bombardment and ground combat, roll modifiers and a GUI.

Compile the program: javac CombatSimulator.java
Run the program: java CombatSimulator <ship type> <number of ships> [<ship type> <number of ships>]

Ship legend:
c - carrier, c2 - carrier 2, cr - cruiser, cr2 - cruiser 2, d - destroyer, d2 - destroyer 2 (or Argent Flight's Strike Wing Alpha 1), d3 - Argent Flight's Strike Wing Alpha 2, dr - dreadnought, dr2 - dreadnought 2, dr3 - L1z1x's Super Dreadnought 2, f - fighter, f2 - fighter 2 (or Naalu's Hybrid Crystal Fighter 1), f3 - Naalu's Hybrid Crystal Fighter 2
