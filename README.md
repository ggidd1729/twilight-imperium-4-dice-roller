This program is an assistive tool for the board game Twilight Imperium 4.

Compile and run the CombatSimulator file to open a GUI. From there you can select your TI4 faction, amass your fleet, apply modifiers and roll dice for space combat.

Planned additions: faction search function, unit sprites, adaptive UI, more combat phases (space cannon, anti-fighter barrage, bombardment, ground combat).
